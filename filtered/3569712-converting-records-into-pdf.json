{"content":"This article goes over how to convert a record that hasn't been saved to PDF, not an already saved record in your database. If you're interested in printing records after they've already been saved you should refer to our other article on this topic, Print and Export Individual RecordsEvery now and then you may get an error message upon record save that says: \"Could not save record. Please contact your administrator.\" When this happens on a record, it can be resolved by clearing your browser cache. This solution however, will cause you to lose the data you just entered. A workaround for this is converting your record into a PDF that you can refer back to later. If you look at the URL in your browser's address bar, you'll see that it says \"new\" at the end. This means the record has not been saved. While on the record press CTRL + P on your keyboard to go into print mode.Select \"Save as PDF\" in the first drop downClick \"Save\"Choose where to save the PDF file Save the PDF fileWhen you open the PDF file, you should be able to copy and paste the data from text fields from the PDF to the record itself. This can be useful when coming across those record save errors. Also, if you fill out a record but are not ready to submit it yet, you can save a copy of it to refer to later.","title":"Converting Records Into PDF","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/3569712-converting-records-into-pdf"}
