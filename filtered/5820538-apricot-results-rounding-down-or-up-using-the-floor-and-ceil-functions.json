{"content":"When working in Apricot Results, you may want to round a number down or up in order to make your data more succinct. In order to do this, you can use the floor or ceil functions.The floor function rounds the number down to the nearest whole number. Formulas using this function will be set up as follows:=floor([Variable with Number])For example, lets say you have a variable [Age in Years] that is equal to 1.8. Since it is years, you would want to round down to 1. To do this, you would use the formula =floor([Age in Years]). Alternatively, the ceil function will round up. Formulas using this function will be set up as follows:=ceil([Variable with Number])For example, lets say you have a variable [Average Days in Program] that is equal to 30.15. You would want to round up to 31. To do this, you would use the formula =ceil([Average Days in Program]). One helpful thing to remember is that in floors are the lowest point in a room, and the floor function lowers a number, while ceilings are the highest point in a room, and the ceil function raises a number up.","title":"Apricot Results | Rounding Down or Up using the Floor and Ceil functions","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/5820538-apricot-results-rounding-down-or-up-using-the-floor-and-ceil-functions"}
