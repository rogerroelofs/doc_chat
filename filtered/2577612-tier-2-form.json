{"content":"Your Apricot database collects information on forms that are created in a two tier structure.Tier 1 forms are \"first level\" or \"parent\" forms that are often used to collect information on individual clients or participants. By creating one record for each person who receives services, you can prevent duplicate entries in your database. In the screenshot above, 'Participant Profile' is the Tier 1 form.Tier 2 forms are \"second level\" or \"child\" forms that are often used to collect information on services or programs that each client might access. By creating a record for each time a client comes in for services, you can see at a glance how many times a person has been served or track progress over a period of time. In the screenshot above, 'Program Enrollment and Exit' and 'Individualized Service' are the Tier 2 forms.Â ","title":"Tier 2 Form","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/2577612-tier-2-form"}
