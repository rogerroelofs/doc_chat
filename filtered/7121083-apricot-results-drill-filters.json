{"content":"Drill Filters are a feature that must be turned on to use in a report, and are a much more simplified than setting up an input control.First, drill filters must be enabled by clicking on the 3 dot button under Analyze and select Drill:Once the drill is enabled, you can now select what to filter on. If there are Tier 1 and Tier 2 forms present in the query, the forms will be broken up into separate object selections:Once you select the object you want to filter on, you can only select a single data point of the available options. For example, if you are filtering on an object that pulls dates, you are only able to choose a single date, if the object is a participant's name, you can only choose a single participant.Additionally, there is a pre-defined cell named Drill Filter. Adding this to the report inserts an individual cell that shows what the Drill Filter is being filtered on.If a second drill filter is added, it can only be filtered on the data present in the report, and it will be added to the cell if that is also in the report:","title":"Apricot Results: Drill Filters","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/7121083-apricot-results-drill-filters"}
