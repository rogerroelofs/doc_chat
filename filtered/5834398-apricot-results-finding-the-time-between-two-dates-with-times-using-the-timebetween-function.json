{"content":"When you are recording dates and times, you may need to see how long it is between  two specific dates with times. This can be done using the timebetween function. This function lets you find the time between two dates with times, and choose how you'd like it shown (Minutes, Hours, Days etc).The formula will be set up as follows:=timebetween([Date with time 1],[Date with time 2],period/unit of time)The period/unit of time will be how you want the time to be measured. The options are as followsMillisecondPeriod.SecondPeriodMinutePeriodHourPeriodDayPeriodWeekPeriodMonthPeriodQuarterPeriodSemesterPeriodYearPeriodFor example, lets say you have two date objects with times: [Datetime A] which is equal to 12/21/21 at 3:00 PM[Datetime B] which is equal to 12/22/21 at 6:00 PMIf you wanted to find the amount of hours between these two objects, you would set up a formula like:=TimeBetween([Datetime A];[Datetime B];HourPeriod)This shows that there are 27 hours between 12/21/21 at 3:00 PM and 12/22/21 at 6:00 PM.
