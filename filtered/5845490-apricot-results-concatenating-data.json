{"content":"When working in Apricot Results, you may need to combine or concatenate data. This is helpful for actions such as making new Identifiers, changing name formatting, or even formatting a date differently. There are a few methods to do this. If you are trying to combine any type of object or number with text strings, you can just put a plus sign (+) between the two (or more) objects or text strings you are trying to concatenate. For example, let's say you are counting students that went on a trip in a variable called [Students]. You could set up the formula like =[Students]+\" Total Students.\"If the total number of students is equal to 14, variable would show \"14 Total Students\"because the number of students in the [Students] variable would be concatenated with the text string \"Total Students.\"If you need to concatenate two numbers, on the other hand, you cannot use the plus sign. This is because it would just give you a sum of the two numbers. Instead, you could use the Concatenate function. For example, if we're trying to add a Form Identifier and Record ID to make a new identifier, we could make a variable saying =Concatenation([Form ID];Concatenation(\"_\";[Record])). If the Form ID is 635 and the Record ID is 154, this formula would give us \"635_154.\"More Exmaples:If [A] is a number and [A] = 1, Concatenation([A];[A]) returns \"2\".If [A] is a string and [A] = 1, Concatenation([A];[A]) returns \"11\".If [A] is a string, [B] is a number, [A] = 1 and [B] = 2, Concatenation([A];[B]) returns \"12\".","title":"Apricot Results | Concatenating Data","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/5845490-apricot-results-concatenating-data"}
