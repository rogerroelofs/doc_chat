You can only export one form at a time.Modification Date (optional): this radio button defaults to \"All.\" You can adjust it to different date filters which would export data based on the Modification Date system field. Note: Â If the record was only created and never modified the Creation Date and Modification Date are the same.File Format: this radio button defaults to \".XLXS\" and can be changed to a different format. Please note, XLXS can store more data than XLS and is a Microsoft Excel file format. You may also choose to export as a CSV file which stores data in plain text and can be opened by Excel and other compatible programs.Export Your Database: this button will export the data based on your selections in numbers 3 through 5. Depending on how much data is in your system this may take some time.Data Archives do not export the linking relationship of linking fields (Record ID to Record ID). You will need to build a report for each linking field on a form to retrieve the related record and the Record ID.Data Archives do not export the linking relationship of dynamic fields (Record ID to Record ID). You will need to build a report for each linking field on a form to retrieve the related record and the Record ID.Data Archives do not export most System Fields (like Created By or Creation Date).

If this occurs, reduce the date range and try again.
