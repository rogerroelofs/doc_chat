{"content":"Apricot Results Reporting is much more powerful than Apricot's native reporting, but it's also much more complex. Currently, it is only available in Apricot 360, and access is limited to Administrators.\n\nThe reporting potential of Results Reporting is nearly limitless with enough Webi knowledge, data knowledge, and with the right resources. This page serves to help any results beginner get started with Apricot Results Reporting, and provides links to additional resources which will assist in growing your knowledge of the platform.Getting StartedAccessing Results Reporting\nHow Do I Run a Report?Learning MoreTrainingsSupportOur Knowledge BaseSAP Knowledge BaseOutside ResourcesNavigate to the Administrator side of ApricotOn the Navigation Panel, expand the Report CenterSelect Apricot Results ReportingThe Results Reporting interface will open in a new tab. If it does not open, ensure it was not blocked by your browser.This is the Results Reporting interface. Take special note of the Folders, Recent Documents, and Recycle Bin areas to start with.\n\nKnowing your folders, and where your reports are stored, will be essential for coordinating with support and making sure they're seeing the same version of a report as you are.\n\nThe Recycle Bin stores deleted reports for a brief period. If a report is accidentally deleted, this is your best chance at being able to restore it.\n\nRecent Documents will show the reports you've run or edited most recently, and is the most convenient way to pick up where you last left off.\n\nScroll to the bottom of this page to see the \"Web Intelligence\" Application. This is the button we select to create a new report.\nIn order to start reporting, we'll need to first take some steps on the Apricot side of things. Form settings need to be adjusted in order to make them available to use as a \"Universe\" - that is, a data source - for our reports. Once this setting has been changed, it takes some time before the form becomes available. We recommend waiting at least fifteen minutes between enabling a form and attempting to access it in the Results Interface.\n\nWhen you select \"Web Intelligence\" under Applications (see bottom of previous section), a new report will be created, and you will be asked to Select a Data Source. To begin with, we want to select Universe.You will see that each Tier 1 form enabled has its own associated universe, which also carries the data for each associated Tier 2 form that is also enabled for Results Reporting. Because of this, the available universes will vary depending on your organization's specific implementation. You'll also see our three standard universes. We recommend that beginners avoid using these standard universes, as working with them is more technically demanding.\nI have selected my \"Participant Profile\" universe for this example, which brings us to the Query Panel below:\nThis is the list of \"Objects\" or data points from our universe. We want to carefully consider what data we need to report on, and bring only the objects we need over to the \"Results Objects\" panel. You'll notice that, at the bottom of this folder's contents, there are also folders for each Tier 2 form associated with this Tier 1 form that has been enabled for results reporting.The \"Results Objects\" are the data points we're bringing into our report. On initial creation, our report will automatically bring these into a table. Any objects added later will need to be manually added to existing tables. Clicking on an object here will highlight it in the list of \"Objects\" in the panel on the left, allowing us to locate them easily.This is the \"Query Filters\" panel. When dragging an object here, logic can be set to restrict the data brought into a report. For example, dragging in the \"Sites\" object can allow us to decide exactly which Sites we want included in our results. These can also be set to prompt the user running the report, so that a single report can be run according to the specific needs of multiple users.Once we have set up your report, select \"Run\" in the bottom right portion of this window in order to retrieve your data:This is the table automatically generated by our \"Query\". It includes all the objects we chose to include in our report.These are our \"Dimensions.\" It is a list of all the data points we chose to include in our report, as well as any variables we create. To ensure this panel is visible, highlight the clipboard icon in the top right.This icon which shows a graph and a gear is used to return to the Query Panel and make adjustments to our filters or data points. New data points added to an existing query will be added to our \"Dimensions\" but not any of our existing tables.Going through our Apricot Results Bootcamps and Apricot Results Labs is the best way to understand Apricot Results Reporting and all its possibilities. You can register for courses or contact your account manager (accountmanagement@bonterratech.com) to look into report training subscriptions.Our Support team is here to help when you encounter specific issues and roadblocks. We can bridge the gap when it comes to understanding Apricot Results Reporting. However, support can not provide consultation, trainings, or report building. Our Professional Services, Training, and Advanced Support Consultants can provide those services to your organization if needed, just speak to your account manager.We have many articles in our knowledge base, which can be searched freely. We recommend searching by keywords that you see in the software like \"Universe\", \"Build Report\", \"Sum\", etc. Our knowledge base provides best practices, tips and tricks, and Apricot-specific Results answers.\n\nAs a next step, we have a table of contents specifically for Apricot Results which we would recommend making use of:While inside of Apricot Results, you might see hyperlinks to another online Results knowledge base. It is also available under Reporting Dashboard > \"Help Menu\" > \"Help\"This knowledge base provides detailed documentation on most functions and features. It is a quick way to get a basic and straightforward understanding of anything in Apricot Results.We utilize SAP Business Objects 4.3 Web Intelligence and online videos are an excellent source for learning how to navigate the software. Of course, online videos may look slightly different from our display or have certain functions that we do not offer, but it is not a bad place to start!\n\nFor best results, keep in mind our exact version of Business Objects is currently:\nSAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 4.3 Support Pack 1 Patch 6Version : 14.3.1.3910.6","title":"Bonterra Case Management Results | Getting Started","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/8234466-bonterra-case-management-results-getting-started"}
