{"content":"A universe is not the only possible data source to build a custom Results Report on, there are times when using another custom report is necessary.When a custom report is used as a data source, all objects and variables within that report become available as objects in the final report. In the below examples, we need to filter a report to only see the participants that have had an adventure within 75 days of the current date.This report will need to include all of the objects the final report will use. Once all objects have been added to the query. Run the report. With the report run, we see everyone whether they have had an adventure or not, and all dates. But, we only need to see the adventures that happens within the last 75 days.The variables created in the source report will become objects that can be used in the final report. For the purposes of the example, 2 variables are made:1 variable to capture the current date1 variable to capture the date 75 days previousOnce the variables needed are made, save the report.Start a new report, and when selecting the data source, choose Web Intelligence document and select OK.Find the folder of the source report, select the source report, and then select Open.Now we can see all of our available objects, including the 2 variables that were made:Once again, in this example, the report needs to filter out anyone that hasn't had an adventure in the last 75 days.Bring all the necessary objects into the query, including our 2 filter objects: 75 Days Previous and Current Date. Select Apply changes and close. This step is necessary to make the variables available to filter on.Open the query panel again, and in this case, the Date of Adventure_1991 field is what this report's filter will be based on. Since it will be a date range, and the filters will be based on Object From This Query, we need to add it to the filter twice. Once that field is in the query filter panel choose the qualifier. For a date range, we need Greater than or Equal to as well as Less than or Equal to. Choose the 3 bar drop down and choose Object from this query.This filter requires the date range to be after 75 days previous, but before the current date. It will look like this:After the filters are set up. Run the report.Once the report is run, and the necessary fields are pulled into a table, only our 4 adventures within the 75 day date range are present in the report.Note:It's important to keep in mind that in cases where the source report has an active set of variables, it will need to be refreshed for the final report to show accurate data. In this case, the Current Date will change every day, making the date of the 75 day previous change as well.","title":"Apricot Results: Using a Custom Report as a Data Source","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/5837136-apricot-results-using-a-custom-report-as-a-data-source"}
