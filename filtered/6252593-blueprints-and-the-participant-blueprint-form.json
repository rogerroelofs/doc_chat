{"content":"What is a Blueprint form?How can I tell that my form is the Participant Blueprint form?Why should I use the Blueprint form when I can make my own Participant form?What can and can't be customized in the Participant Blueprint formThe term \"Blueprint Form\" refers to a restricted form that is included with the latest versions of Apricot, and for those who have this it is named the \"Participant\" form. The Participant Blueprint form lays the foundation for exciting features and functionality coming in the future, including potential ideas like the ability to send our clients full sets of forms and reports at the click of a button.There are a few ways. The quickest and easiest way is by attempting to drag a field into the “Participant Details” section of the form (should be the very first section). When you attempt this you will see a popup indicating “Unable to add field to a restricted section”.The main reason that we would encourage you to use the restricted form is because we are focused on expanding our functionality around the Blueprint form. Eventually, this will allow us to accomplish things like sending full sets of tier 2 forms and prebuilt reports and associate them to your existing Participant information. If you decide not use the Participant Blueprint, you may not be able to benefit from related functionality in the future.The first thing to bear in mind is that nearly everything in the Participant Blueprint is optional and can be made hidden, with only the following exceptions:Name - Used as a duplicate check and therefore cannot be made hiddenDate of Birth - Same as aboveAdditional unrestricted Sections can be added as needed to capture any additional information for your participants.","title":"Blueprints and the Participant Blueprint Form","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/6252593-blueprints-and-the-participant-blueprint-form"}
