Several forms designated as specific types of AFF-compatible forms are recommended but are not required in order for the grant tool to operate.Each reviewer fills out this Tier 1 form when they first apply to become a reviewer or when they first set themselves up as users in the system. This form is designed to collect general information like contact name and email address for a reviewer.Using reviewers is not required for the grant workflow to be functional, but it is *highly recommended.* Some grants are restricted and agencies must be invited to apply. After an agency completes an applicant profile form, the Funder/Administrator completes a grant invitation form to indicate that the agency is allowed to apply for funding. In this case, the applicant profile form is like a letter of interest and the grant invitation form is like a letter of acceptance. To designate a new or existing form as an AFF-specific form, open the form for editing and open the top gear box.Under Apricot for Funders Form Type, select the appropriate type of form. AFF Tier 1 form types are the only options available if you are creating or editing a Tier 1 form. AFF Tier 2 form types will be available when you are creating or editing a Tier 2 form.Select Apply.","title":"Optional Additional AFF Forms","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/2571365-optional-additional-aff-forms"}
