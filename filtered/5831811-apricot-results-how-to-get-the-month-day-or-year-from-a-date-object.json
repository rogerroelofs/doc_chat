{"content":"When using Apricot Results, you may need to isolate either the month, year or day from a date object. A few uses for this could be:Separating a year into quarters using the month (Q1= January, February, March, etc.)Finding out how many participants were enrolled in one yearComparing data from the beginning of a month to data at the end of a monthIn order to do this, there are a few different functions you can use:In all examples, we can assume that object in question is [Date Object], and that the one date it shows is 07/29/1992To get the month from a date, you can use either the month or monthnumberofyear functions, depending on how you want it to show.The Month function will show the month fully written as text. For example, If [Date Object] shows \"07/29/1992\" then =Month([Date Object]) will show \"July\"Alternatively, if you want to show the month as a number, you can use the monthnumberofyear function. For example, If [Date Object] shows \"07/29/1992\" then =Monthnumberofyear([Date Object]) will show \"7\"To get the year from a date, you simply use the year function. For example, If [Date Object] shows \"07/29/1992\" then =year([Date Object]) will show \"1992\"In order to get the day from date, you can use the daynumberofmonth function. For example, If [Date Object] shows \"07/29/1992\" then =daynumberofmonth([Date Object]) will show \"29\"You can even find which day of the week a date is on by using dayname or daynumberofweek functionsFor example, If [Date Object] shows \"07/29/1992\" then=dayname([Date Object]) will show \"Wednesday\"and=daynumberofweek([Date Object]) will show \"3\"","title":"Apricot Results | How to Get the Month, Day, or Year from a Date Object","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/5831811-apricot-results-how-to-get-the-month-day-or-year-from-a-date-object"}
