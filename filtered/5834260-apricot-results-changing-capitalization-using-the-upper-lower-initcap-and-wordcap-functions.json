{"content":"When reporting, you may need to change the capitalization of a string of text to make all the letters upper-case or lower-case.To make all letters capital, you can use the upper function.For example, if the [State] object returns the text \"Maryland,\" you could use the formula =upper([State]) to return the text \"MARYLAND,\" which will have all the letters capitalized.Conversely, you may want to remove all capitalization. to do this, you could use the lower function.For example, if the [State] object returns the text \"Maryland,\" you could use the formula =lower([State]) to return the text \"maryland,\" which will make the letter \"m\" lowercase.In some situations, you may just want the first letter of a string to be capitalized. This can be done using the Initcap funciton.For example, if the [Notes] object returns the text \"he will see a doctor next week,\" you could use the formula =initcap([Notes]) to return the text \"He will see a doctor next week,\" which will capitalize the \"H\" at the beginning of the text string.Sometimes you need to capitalize the first letter of every word in a string of text. This can be done using the wordcap function.For example, if the [Family member name] object returns the text \"john smith,\" you could use the formula =wordcap([Family member name]) to return the text \"John Smith,\" which will capitalize the \"J\" and \"S\" at the beginning of each word.","title":"Apricot Results | Changing Capitalization using the Upper, Lower, Initcap and WordCap functions","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/5834260-apricot-results-changing-capitalization-using-the-upper-lower-initcap-and-wordcap-functions"}
