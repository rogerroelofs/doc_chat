Please reach out to the Apricot Support Team with any questions you may have about Apricot for Funders that are not answered here.Because the AFF form structure requires three different Tier 1 forms (Applicant Profile, Application Intake, and Reviewer Profile) you will need to use linking fields to create a way for these forms to be connected.
