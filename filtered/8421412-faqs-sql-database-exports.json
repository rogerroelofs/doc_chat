Our team compresses and password-protects the file in a 7zip format. 7zip is open source and is available as a free download, which you will need to use to extract the files. Most PCs will be x64 (64 bit Windows) or x86 (32 bit Windows). Yes, we can do a .csv file from reports, but it would need to be re-scoped and include SC hours.No, this cannot be requested as we use automatic backups already in place that vary significantly on time of day.There is a table called “forms_metadata_view” in the SQL backup which has your fields/sections/forms mapping. You will need to restore it to see it. The password provided is only needed to unzip the files. It is not needed to access mySQL, as you will need to set up your own password. Yes, we can get this password from our CloudOps team for you.They were not in scope and are therefore not provided.  We can troubleshoot actually accessing the file itself from our AWS. However, we cannot assist with downloading or using MSSQL, MySQL, or any other tools used to extract the data from the received SQL file.You may need to download another app to access zipped files on a Mac. On MacOS, we recommend using The Unarchiver, a free file archiving tool.We store database backups for 13 months after it's created.","title":"FAQs | SQL Database Exports","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/8421412-faqs-sql-database-exports"}
