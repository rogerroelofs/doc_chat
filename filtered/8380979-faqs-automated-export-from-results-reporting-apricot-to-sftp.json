{"content":"This document covers basic information and frequently asked questions about automated exports from Apricot Results Reporting. Once set up, this process functions similarly to scheduled reports, but sends the files to an SFTP file server to be collected by the client. This article assumes the client already has access to this functionality; if this is not the case, we recommend reaching out to your Client Success Manager or Account Manager to begin the process.Automated Exports from Results Reporting use the scheduled reports feature. Once it has been set up, reports scheduled to an SFTP server can be rescheduled, modified, paused, or stopped just like any other scheduled report. Further details about this process can be found in the related article:Aside from delivering to a different destination, the functionality is the same. The same file formats can be chosen, and the naming convention of the output file can be determined in the same way. The same size limits of the export will still apply, but may be slightly different from a report scheduled via email, due to how the data is being sent, and because many email servers have their own additional limitations.Reports scheduled via this feature are stored online to be accessed via an SFTP protocol or program. Files remain in storage for 30 days before being automatically deleted. Our Professional Services team recommends using CyberDuck, a free and open source FTP/SFTP solution for accessing your files. This has been tested and verified by the team to ensure it will work for accessing your files. Our team recommends performing any initial testing with CyberDuck prior to using your organization's own FTP/SFTP software. This will help our troubleshoot any potential issues.Different SFTP programs have different options for how to handle files with matching information. Each time a file is sent, a setting on the client's side controls whether files under certain parameters are duplicated or overwritten, some with more granularity of options than others.\n\nIn CyberDuck, this setting looks at files with exactly matching file names. If a recurring report is scheduled with the exact same file name each time, this option under Edit > Preferences (as shown below) controls whether those files are overwritten or not.","title":"FAQs | Automated Export from Results Reporting (Apricot to SFTP)","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/8380979-faqs-automated-export-from-results-reporting-apricot-to-sftp"}
