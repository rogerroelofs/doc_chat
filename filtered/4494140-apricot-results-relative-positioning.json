{"content":"When working in Apricot Results, you may create a table with limited data, but that data may grow over time. If you have multiple tables in your report, the tables may eventually start to overlap. To prevent this, you can you implement relative positioning within your report.For example, if you have a report with two tables, it may start off like this:If you begin adding objects to the first table, it could end up over or behind the data in the second table:To account for this, add relative positioning to the tables.\nThe first thing you want to do is identify which tables you want to apply relative positioning to. To do this, open the Report Structure tab on the right side panel within the report. OPTIONAL: You can also re-name the tables to better identify the data you are looking at. Just select the table in the Report Structure view, and select the Display Settings (the eye icon) in the panel to the left, and then the pencil to change the name.Once you have identified the tables you want to add relative positioning to, you can access the relative positioning options in a couple of ways:\n1. With the table you want to format selected, navigate to Format panel to the right side of your report and choose the Layout Settings tab2. Right click the table you want to format, select Format Table. From the Format Table options, select Layout Settings.\nOnce you have the Layout Settings tab open in the Report Element panel, find the Relative Position section. This is where you can add the relative positioning.If you want to format the tables horizontally, select the first option. This will let you format tables to the left edge of the report, or the left or right side of another table.\nIf you select Left (or Right) side of... an option will appear that will allow you to select the object you want to position the table against.\nIf you want to format the tables vertically, select the second option. Click enter to show the changes if Instant Apply is selected, or hit Apply to save the changes.","title":"Apricot Results | Relative Positioning","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/4494140-apricot-results-relative-positioning"}
