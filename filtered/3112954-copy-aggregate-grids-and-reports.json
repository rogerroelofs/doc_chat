An entire aggregate report can be copied as well.An aggregate report can be made up of one or more than one grid or section.

If you have filtered the data sources on the destination report and any of these data sources are shared by the grid you are copying, you may see differences in the reported numbers. You can revert these changes by removing the data source filters on the destination report and re-building them at the row, column, or cell level.1.
