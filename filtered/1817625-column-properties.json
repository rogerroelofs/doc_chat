Ideal for a date field that contains dates that have already passed.Days from Now: counts the number of days between today's date and the date in the column.

The available answers are the Participants' last names. The data is now organized into groups, a separate group for each unique last name.We now get a row count for each \"Grouping.\"Note: Groupings are limited to 4 per report section. Â If you need to group on more than 4 columns, we suggest splitting the outermost grouping into report sections of their own.Formatting OptionsThe Formatting section of the column properties is where cosmetic changes can be managed.Sort order: Choose \"Ascending\" or \"Descending.\" This can be useful if you need to order date values or put names in alphabetical order.Hidden: This will hide your column when it is run. It will still appear in the Report Builder, but this column gear box will be grayed out. This can be useful if you are including calculations in your report and would like to hide the columns that are necessary to create the final calculations.Width: You can set a width for your column up to 440 pixels. The minimum width of a column depends on the width of the data in it.Alignment: Justifies the column title and contents.Font Style: Sets the column title and contents to the selected style.Color: Changes the column title and contents. Color choices are dependent on which browser you are using (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)Form InfoExpand the black arrow next to \"Form Info\" to reveal the form, section, and field the column came from. This can be useful if you need to make edits to a report someone else built or if you re-named a column and now need to figure out where it came from.Form: Name of the form your column came from.Section: Name of the section in the form your column came from.Field: Name of the specific field in the form your column came from.When you expand the \"Form Info\" section in the column properties, the form and section will become highlighted in green in the right hand menu. This makes it easy to find the form in the Field Choices palette.Special Columns: Calculation ColumnsSpecial columns allow you to add additional math and time calculations and text concatenations to your report. These columns do not exist as fields in your forms, but they can assist you in analyzing your data.Calculation column types include:Number Calc: Allows you to add, subtract, multiply or divide two or more numeric columns in your report section.Date/Time Calc: Calculates the time between two date/time columns in your report section.Text Calc: Allows you to concatenate text (combine two or more text columns) in your report section.2. To use a special column in your report, drag and drop it into your report section as you would with other fields from your forms.Number Calc ColumnClick into the text box at the top to change the header of your calculation column.The same data styles and summary options are available here as for other columns with numeric or number values.Choose your Calculation Type. Here we are calculating how many years until our clients turn 18, so we are going to choose \"Subtract.\"Choose your Calculation Columns. Expand the black arrow in the \"Select a Column\" dropdown to select the first column you would like to use in your calculation. The choices available here will be all the numeric or number value columns in your report. If you do not see a column here but think it should be here, check its data style. A numeric column that has been changed to a text value will not show up here. \"[Static Value]\" allows you to enter in your own number or numeric value to use in the calculation. If we need to find out how many years we have until our clients turn 18, we would enter a [Static Value] of 18 for the top Calculation Column and our Age column as the second Calculation Column.If you need to add more columns to your calculation, you can do so by clicking the \"+\" sign.Date/Time Calc ColumnClick into the text box at the top to change the header of your calculation column.The same data styles and summary options are available here as for other columns with date or time values.Choose your Calculation Type. Your choice here will determine which columns are available under \"Calculation Columns.\" If you choose \"Days Between,\" \"Days After\" or \"Days Before,\" your date columns will be shown as available. If you choose \"Time Between,\" only columns with time data will be available.Expand the black arrow in the \"Select a Column\" box to select the column you would like to use in your calculation. - \"[Static Value]\" allows you to enter in your own date or time value to use in the calculation. If you need to see how many days someone has been in the program since the beginning of the year, January 1 (01/01/2014, for example) would be your static date value.+Text Calc ColumnAlthough this column is called \"Text Calc,\" it is not limited to only the text columns in your report. It can be used to combine the data from several columns into one.\"Combine\" is the only calculation type in a text calc column. It will add together whatever appears in the columns you select.Choose your columns to combine by expanding the black arrow next to \"Select a Column.\"If you need more columns, add them by selecting the + sign.A common use for a text calc column is to combine names into one field, so that it looks cleaner on a report. Or you may choose to combine a client name with the name of the program they are participating in, or their name with their ID number.When combining several fields, it can be useful to select [Static Value] of a space - or a comma and a space - to separate the column values in your final result.Summary ColumnsSummary Columns allow you to bring the results of an entire report section into one column. It can be useful if you needed several report sections to create or calculate results and would like to combine them into one area of your Report, where they can be highlighted or be easier to read.Summary Column types include:Section Summary: Displays the summary from one column in any other section in your report.Section Count: Displays the count from one other section in your report.2. To use a Summary Column in your report, drag and drop it into your report section as you would with other fields from your forms.\n3. Summary Columns work best in their own section in a report.Section SummaryFirst select your report section by expanding the black arrow under \"Choose a Section.\"Then select your column by expanding the black arrow under \"Choose a Column.\"Note: Only columns that have a \"summary\" value or display style will appear here.
