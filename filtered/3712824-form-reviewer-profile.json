These forms can be turned on or turned off during specific time periods in a particular funding cycle. Forms that are turned on will be accessible for users to create, edit and complete.The Reviewer Profile form is a Tier 1 Form to be completed once by each reviewer (see article: Reviewer) prior to the review part of the funding cycle.When creating a Reviewer Profile form, include basic information that is not expected to change from year to year. This could include contact information for your reviewer, for example, or identifying an area of expertise.In subsequent years or funding cycles, the information included in the Reviewer Profile form will remain in the AFF system and will not need to be re-entered. It can be updated if necessary, but should not contain any information that is expected to change between one funding cycle and another or that needs to be tracked historically.Creating a New Reviewer Profile Form1.
