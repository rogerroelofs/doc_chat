{"content":"When assigning a new program to Tier 2 records, Apricot will automatically assign the Tier 1 record to the same program, if the Tier 1 record was not already assigned to that program.Program roll up exists due to how record navigation functions in Apricot. Navigating to a Tier 2 record requires that a user is also able to navigate and have access to a document folder as a whole, therefore if a Program is added to a Tier 2 record and that set of users should be able to access that information and navigate to it, the Program must also be added to its associated Tier 1 record in order for that to be possible.The message \"The Tier 1 record(s) will also be added to this program\" will appear in the Assign Programs pop-up on the Tier 2 record if the Tier 1 record is not already assigned. In the example below, if you are going to assign the \"Advocacy\" program to a Tier 2 record, then it will also be added to the Tier 1 record if it is not already assigned to the record.When removing assigned programs from a Tier 1 record, Apricot will automatically remove the programs from the Tier 2 records if they had the same program assigned as the Tier 1 record. Tier 2 records cannot be assigned to a program that is not already assigned to the Tier 1 record.In the example below, let's say you have a Tier 1 record and Tier 2 record that are both assigned to the \"Advocacy\" and \"College Prep\" programs. If you remove the \"Advocacy\" and \"College Prep\" programs from the Tier 1 record, then it will also be removed from the Tier 2 record automatically.","title":"Program Roll Up & Roll Down","url":"https://apricot-articles.socialsolutions.com/en/articles/4172342-program-roll-up-roll-down"}
