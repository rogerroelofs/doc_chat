# DocChat

This app uses the OpenAI api to use the docs from apricot-articles to feed GPT4 to answer questions about how to use Apricot.

Configure your OpenAI API key and org id in `.env` with the following:

```
OPENAI_KEY=YOUR_KEY
OPENAI_ORG_ID=YOUR_ORG_ID
```
The key and org id can be made at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings respectively.
